                <p>I’m a Web Developer based in Baltimore, Maryland, specializing in user-centric design and modern front-end technologies. My role as a Web Manager for a nationwide wholesale supplier has given me extensive experience running digital marketing campaigns—leveraging tools like Google Analytics, Google Ads, and Mailchimp—to drive engagement and conversions.</p>

                <p>My background in digital, direct, and customer relationship marketing dates back to the early 2000s, when I was a young creator helping small start-ups establish their web presence. I’ve always enjoyed taking things apart and rebuilding them—an inquisitiveness that continues to drive my passion for learning emerging technologies. ​</p>
