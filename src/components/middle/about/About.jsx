                <p>I am a Web Developer out of Baltimore, Maryland. I deliver strategic insight, hands-on design, and frontend development using modern frontend web technologies. Working as a Web Manager for a nationwide wholesale supplier has also provided me with extensive experience running digital marketing campaigns using technologies like Google Analytics, Google Adsense, and Mailchimp.</p>

                <p>My background in digital, direct, and customer relationship marketing goes back as far as the early 2000 when I was a young creator for small start-ups interested in creating a web presence. It has always been a hobby of mind to take things apart and build them again. That inquisitiveness has helped me learn and continue to learn technologies that interest me.  â€‹</p>
